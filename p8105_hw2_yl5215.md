# Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset:

1.  Specify the sheet in the Excel file to omit non-data entries (rows
    with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
    `read_excel()`.
2.  Rename variable names for better clarity using
    `janitor::clean_names` and `rename()`.
3.  Omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data using
    `drop_na()`.
4.  round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts
    the result to an integer variable using `round()` and `as.integer`.

``` r
mr_wheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 1, skip = 1, range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names(dat = .) %>%
  rename(.data = ., weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster, year, date) %>%
  mutate(.data = ., sports_balls = as.integer((round(sports_balls))))
```

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset by following similar steps:

``` r
prof_wheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 2, skip = 1, range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names(dat = .) %>%
  rename(.data = ., weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster, year, date) %>%
  mutate(.data = ., dumpster = as.double(dumpster), year = as.character(year),  sports_balls = NA)
```

Combine `mr_wheel_df` and `prof_wheel_df` to produce a single tidy
dataset using `bind_rows`. To keep track of which Trash Wheel is which,
an additional variable to both datasets is added before combining.

``` r
mr_wheel_df  = 
  mr_wheel_df %>% 
  mutate(.data = ., trash_wheel_type = "mr_trash_wheel")
prof_wheel_df =
  prof_wheel_df %>%
  mutate(.data = ., trash_wheel_type = "prof_trash_wheel") 
combine_trash_df = bind_rows(mr_wheel_df, prof_wheel_df)
```

To make a summary about the datasets:

``` r
com_row = nrow(combine_trash_df)
com_col = ncol(combine_trash_df)

mr_row = nrow(mr_wheel_df)
pro_row = nrow(prof_wheel_df)
```

The datasets `mr_wheel_df` and `prof_wheel_df` include information about
trash collected by “Mr. Trash Wheel” and “Professor Trash Wheel”
respectively. `mr_wheel_df` contains 547 rows of data (observations) and
`prof_wheel_df` contains 94 rows of data (observations). The dataset
`combine_trash_df` is generated by combining `mr_wheel_df` and
`prof_wheel_df`, and it contains 641 rows (observations) and 15 columns.
The combined dataset `combine_trash_df` contains variables dumpster,
month, year, date, weight, volume, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls,
homes_powered, trash_wheel_type.

Below shows some example values of these variables:

``` r
head(combine_trash_df[1:5],5)
```

To compute the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel
and the total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in
2020:

``` r
total_weight_prof = 
  combine_trash_df %>%
  filter(trash_wheel_type == "prof_trash_wheel") %>%
  pull(weight) %>%
  sum
```

``` r
total_balls_mr_2020 = 
  combine_trash_df %>%
  filter(trash_wheel_type == "mr_trash_wheel", year == "2020") %>%
  pull(sports_balls) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  sum
```

Therefore, the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel
is 190.12 tons and the total number of sports balls collected by
Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is 856.
